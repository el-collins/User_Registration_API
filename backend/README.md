# User Registration API 🚀
```markdown

Welcome aboard! Our User Registration API is the gateway to a universe of possibilities. It's built with FastAPI to ensure a smooth journey from sign-up to lift-off.

## Features 🌟

- **Simple Sign-Up**: A straightforward route to register new astronauts... I mean, users!
- **Validation Station**: We check all credentials to ensure no alien imposters sneak aboard.
- **Password Fortress**: Our complexity requirements make sure passwords are as strong as a spaceship hull.
- **Error Radar**: If something's amiss, our API sends clear distress signals to guide you back on track.
- **Test Flight**: With FastAPI TestClient, we simulate the registration process to ensure a smooth launch.
